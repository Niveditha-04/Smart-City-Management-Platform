# Smart City Management Platform 

> **Capstone Project â€” IIT Guwahati Micro Degree Program (Computer Science)**
>
> This project was developed as part of my final capstone submission for the IIT Guwahati Micro Degree Program.  
> It demonstrates a full-stack implementation of a **Smart City Management Platform** with real-time dashboards, alerts, notifications, and role-based access.

## Project Overview

The **Smart City Management Platform** is a centralized solution to monitor, analyze, and optimize city infrastructure and services such as **traffic, air quality, waste management, and utilities**.  

It integrates real-time metrics, visual dashboards, and alerting mechanisms to support data-driven decisions for city administrators.

### Key Features Implemented
- **Frontend (React.js)**
  - Real-time dashboard with charts, heatmaps, and trendlines
  - Alerts page to submit and view manual alerts
  - Auto Alerts page for threshold-based anomaly detection and acknowledgements
  - Role-based UI (Admin, Operator, Viewer)

- **Backend (Node.js + Express)**
  - REST API endpoints for authentication, metrics, thresholds, and alerts
  - JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
  - Database integration with PostgreSQL
  - Notifications via **Email (Nodemailer)** and **Web Push API**

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**
  - Tables: `users`, `alerts`, `alerts_breaches`, `metrics_timeseries`, `thresholds`
  - Seed data for sample metrics and roles (Admin, Operator, Viewer)

- **Security**
  - Password hashing with bcrypt
  - Helmet + rate limiting for API hardening
  - CORS configuration

- **Deployment Ready**
  - Dockerized backend + frontend
  - Works locally and on Render (Static Site + Web Service + Postgres)
